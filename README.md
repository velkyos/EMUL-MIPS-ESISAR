  Its goal was to create a mips emulator. It's been separated into two parts.


Part 1 : 
  It is a simple translator from MIPS instructions in Assembly code into the HEXA version this instruction.
  We divided this task into 3 parts :

      - Read a source file line by line and formatting it into a simple line. (Without any space, comment and in All Caps.) 
          Done by Sophie

      - Getting Operator and Operands from the line.
          Done by Benjamin

      - Translate the corresponding instruction into HEXA code.
          Done by Adrien
